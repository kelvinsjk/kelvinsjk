- 👋 Hi, I’m @kelvinsjk Kelvin Soh from Singapore.
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics (combinatorics and graph theory), mathematics education (typically at the high school level), and the development of mathematical content in a digital age.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on Svelte/Sveltekit/Astro, in additional to my own mathematical projects at math-atlas and math-edu
- 📫 How to reach me: My contact details are on [my site Math Atlast](https://math-atlas.vercel.app)
