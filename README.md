- 👋 Hi, I’m @kelvinsjk Kelvin Soh from Singapore.
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics (combinatorics and graph theory), mathematics education (typically at the high school level), and the development of mathematical content in a digital age.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on Svelte/Sveltekit, in additional to my own projects below
- 📫 How to reach me: [kelvinsjk@gmail.com](mailto:kelvinsjk@gmail.com)

## My current projects

- [Math Atlas](https://math-atlas.vercel.app) built in Sapper. Containing notes, questions and quizzes
- [Math Repo](https://math-repo.vercel.app) built in SvelteKit. A repository of past examination questions
- [Math Pro](https://math-pro.vercel.app) built in SvelteKit. Variations of past examination questions + interactive core concept practice
- [3D Vectors](https://3d-vectors.vercel.app) built in SvelteKit. Applet to solve 3d vectors (lines and planes) questions
- [Mathlify](https://github.com/kelvinsjk/mathlify): A library to compute and display mathematics
- [Mathlified](https://github.com/kelvinsjk/mathlified): A KaTeX wrapper 

## Deprecated projects
