- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @kelvinsjk Kelvin Soh from Singapore.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in mathematics (combinatorics and graph theory), mathematics education (typically at the high school level), and the development of mathematical content in a digital age.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects on Svelte/Sveltekit, in additional to my own projects below
- üì´ How to reach me: [kelvinsjk@gmail.com](mailto:kelvinsjk@gmail.com)
- üåê I blog on [kelvin.mathlify.com](kelvin.mathlify.com)

## My current projects

- [Mathlified](https://github.com/kelvinsjk/mathlified): A monorepo of various explorations into displaying Mathematics on the web.
  - [Mathlified framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-sveltekit-tex). Vite plugin facilitating the creation of web+print content (via SvelteKit and LaTeX) using a unified codebase.
  - [Mathlifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathlifier). A KaTeX wrapper.
  - [Mathlifier2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathlifier2). Used in conjuction with Mathlifier in the Mathlified framework to facilitate a write-once, run-anywhere experience for web+print.
  - [Svelte Math](https://svelte-math.vercel.app/) Exploration of the different methods to show math in Svelte/SvelteKit.
  - [MDsveX Math Starter](https://mdsvex-math-starter.vercel.app/) Starter repo for integrating math (via KaTeX) in MDsveX.
- [Mathlify](https://github.com/kelvinsjk/mathlify): A computer algebra system to help create mathematical content typically at high school/beginning college level. Perform computations and get LaTeX output while writing idiomatic code similar to our thought process.
- [Math Pro](https://math-pro.vercel.app) built in SvelteKit. Variations of past examination questions + interactive core concept practice.
- [Math Repo](https://math-repo.vercel.app) built in SvelteKit. A repository of solutions to past Singapore A Levels H2 Math examination questions.
- [Mathlify-rust] The Mathlify CAS written in rust

## Past projects

The following are projects in the past that are still useful but aren't receiving as many updates, either because they are relatively "complete" or because the ideas are being incorporated into one of the newer projects above.

- [3D Vectors](https://3d-vectors.vercel.app) built in SvelteKit. Applet to solve 3d vectors (lines and planes) questions.
- [Math Depot](https://math-repo.vercel.app) built in SvelteKit. A repository of solutions to past Singapore O Levels Additional Math examination questions.
- [Math Atlas](https://math-atlas.vercel.app) built in Sapper. Containing notes, questions and quizzes.
- [Spinner Dinner](https://spinner-dinner.netlify.app/). Can't decide what to eat for dinner? Spin the wheel to decide!
- [Countdown Confetti](https://countdown-confetti.vercel.app/). Have an upcoming date/time you are looking forward to? Set up a countdown timer that ends with a confetting and fireworks explosion.

## Deprecated projects
- [Math Bounty](https://math-bounty.vercel.app) built in Astro. A superset of past examination questions
- [math-edu and math-edu-plus](https://github.com/kelvinsjk/math-edu) Javascript libraries to help compute and display mathematics
