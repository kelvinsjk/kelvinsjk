- 👋 Hi, I’m @kelvinsjk Kelvin Soh from Singapore.
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics (combinatorics and graph theory), mathematics education (typically at the high school level), and the development of mathematical content in a digital age.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on Svelte/Sveltekit/Astro, in additional to my own projects below
- 📫 How to reach me: My contact details are on [my site Math Atlas](https://math-atlas.vercel.app)

## My current projects

- [Math Atlas](https://math-atlas.vercel.app) built in Sapper. Containing notes, questions and quizzes
- [3D Vectors](https://3d-vectors.vercel.app) built in Sveltekit. Applet to solve 3d vectors (lines and planes) questions
- [Math Bounty](https://math-bounty.vercel.app) built in Astro. A superset of past examination questions
- [math-edu and math-edu-plus](https://github.com/kelvinsjk/math-edu) Javascript libraries to help compute and display mathematics
